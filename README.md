# Azure AD (Entra ID) Identity Mini-Lab

**Goal:** Build a small Azure AD (Entra ID) environment to practice identity management: users, groups, MFA, and Conditional Access.

---

## What I Did
- Created a new Entra ID tenant in the Azure portal  
- Added test users and security groups  
- Assigned role-based access (RBAC)  
- Enabled MFA for one group and tested sign-in  
- Built a Conditional Access policy requiring MFA outside the U.S.  
- Captured screenshots and notes

---

## Why It Matters
This lab demonstrates practical knowledge of identity and access management—skills used daily in IT support, systems administration, and technical engineering roles.

---

## Tools
Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) · Conditional Access · MFA (Microsoft Authenticator)

## Screenshots
Screenshots will be uploaded in `/screenshots` once the lab is complete.

## Key Concepts Learned
- MDM vs MAM: device vs app-level management  
- Autopilot workflow: vendor-registered hardware → Entra join → Intune setup  
- Triage by impact & SLA: prioritizing support tickets effectively
